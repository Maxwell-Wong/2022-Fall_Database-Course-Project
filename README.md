# 2022-Fall_Database-Course-Project
##### Course Project Database Systems Fall 2022

##### • Due:  January 14, 2023

### Goal:

 The goal of this project is to provide a realistic experience in the conceptual design, logical design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a relational database and associated applications. First, I shall describe the application, then the categories of requirements, and then some suggestions on how deeply you need to go in each category. A real project of this sort would require a substantial development team working for several months (or more). You will do this alone over several weeks. I have chosen to go with individual rather than group projects because the goal of this project is for you to gain a personal appreciation of the depth and breadth of issues that go into the design of a database application, rather than to have you specialize in just one aspect (and rely on others for the rest).

​	The project can go well beyond the minimal requirements I outline at the end. I encourage such extensions. They could turn into a senior design project or other independent work. 



### Application description:

 The application is an automobile company, such as BYD, Xiaopeng, Weilai, Lixiang, General Motors, Ford, Toyota, or Volkswagen (or maybe a company from yesteryear like Studebaker, Hudson, Nash, or Packard). 

​	In our hypothetical company, it has been decided to redesign a major part of the database that underlies company operations. Unfortunately, the manager assigned to solicit database design proposals is not very computer literate and is unable to provide a very detailed specification at the technical level. Fortunately, you are able to do that. The company needs to keep quite a bit of data, but we shall focus on the following aspects of corporate operations.
